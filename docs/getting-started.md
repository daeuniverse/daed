## How to run

Most of the time, newly proposed changes will be included in `PRs` and will be exported as cross-platform executable binaries in builds (GitHub Action Workflow Build). Noted that newly introduced features are sometimes buggy, do it at your own risk. However, we still highly encourage you to check out our latest builds as it may help us further analyze features stability and resolve potential bugs accordingly.
